This virtual internship was under JP Morgan Chase and Co. on Excel Skills by Forage.

Problem Statement:

The Sales Team wants to know how their unit sales are doing and how can they improve.


Task 1: Excel Keyboard Shortcut

Practice common keyboard shortcuts to make working in Excel more efficient.

Task 2: Conditional Formatting 

Your task is to use Excelâ€™s conditional formatting tools to explore and visualize the characteristics of the data in the dataset.
- Highlight any cells with formula errors in purple with white text.
- Highlight any cells with missing values in yellow.
- Identify accounts that have not been cross-sold with Product 2 by highlighting the appropriate Product 2 cells in orange.
- Identify accounts that have a 5-year sales CAGR of at least 100% by highlighting the appropriate CAGR cells in green and any accounts with a negative CAGR in red with white text.
- Identify accounts in the top 10% of unit sales for 2021 by highlighting the appropriate 2021 unit sales cells in blue.

Task 3: Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) Macros

Your task is to familiarize yourself with recording and using simple macros in Excel, and then create two macros using the same spreadsheet you modified with conditional formatting from Task 2.

You will create two macros and associated buttons:
1. A macro to sort the entire spreadsheet by 5 YR CAGR in descending order to see which accounts have the highest overall 5-year sales growth.
2. A macro to sort the entire spreadsheet by 2021 unit sales in descending order to see which accounts have the highest overall unit sales in 2021.

Task 4: Data Visualization in Excel

Your task is to create a simple dashboard using the account sales dataset.


Task 5: Data-Driven Storytelling

Your task is to write a short PowerPoint presentation to communicate key insights and data from your analysis and visualization work in the prior task.
